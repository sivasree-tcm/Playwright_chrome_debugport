Think of it as a standardized \"bridge\" that lets AI models  access information and perform actions beyond their built - in knowledge   -   like connecting to  databases, APIs, file systems, or other services.  Key Benefits of MCP:  •   Expanded capabilities   -   Your AI assistant can access real - time data, work with your files, connect to  your tools and databases  •   Personalized interactions   -   AI can work with your specific data and context rather than just general  knowledge  •   Streamlined workflows   -   One interface to interact with multiple systems through your AI assistant\n\nMCP Architecture\n\nAutomation   -   MCP  Download Claude Desktop   -   https://claude.ai/download  Nodejs   https://nodejs.org/en  After installation check in terminal  How to Verify : node   - v  Playwright   -   https://github.com/microsoft/playwright - mcp  Sqllite   -   https://github.com/laxmimerit/mcp - server - sqlite  Install   uv   (windows)   irm  https:// astral.sh / uv /install.ps1 |   iex  How to verify :   uv   – version  File :  https://www.npmjs.com/package/@modelcontextprotocol/server - filesystem  Spreadsheet   -   https://github.com/negokaz/excel - mcp - server\n\nColumn   Data Type   Null  Allowed  Primary  Key  Default  Value  emp_id   INTEGER   Yes   Yes   None  name   TEXT   No   No   None  departmen  t   TEXT   Yes   No   None  Column   Data Type   Null  Allowed  Primary  Key  Default  Value  emp_id   INTEGER   Yes   Yes   No  name   TEXT   No   No   None  salary   DECIMAL(  10,2)   Yes   No   None  Create two tables , employee and salary and a excel sheet  Lab   - 4\n\nPython for AI  11:30 to 12:15\n\nPydantic   class  •   Pydantic   is a Python library used to:  •   Define   data models   with type hints.  •   Automatically   validate   and   parse   data.  •   Ensure type safety in APIs, background  tasks, or agents (like those in   CrewAI ).  •   It's part of the   FastAPI   ecosystem and  widely used in modern Python applications.\n\nPydantic   class   –   Lab 5  •   from   pydantic   import   BaseModel  •   class User( BaseModel ):  task_id : int  task_name : str  age : int  Lab : python   pydanticdemo.py  Validation of  Type and Number of  argument\n\nGradio   –   Sample Lab (6)  •   Easy and quick way for launching a UI for a MVP  •   Similar to HTML  •   Can be extended globally  •   Lab : python   pydanticdemo.py  •   Lab 1: Try a simple calculator app\n\nAsync IO\n\nAsyncio\n\nAsyncio\n\nAsync IO\n\nCrewAI  12:15to 1:30 pm\n\nWhat is Agentic AI?  •   Agentic AI refers to intelligent systems that  can   perceive ,   reason ,   act , and   learn   within an  environment to achieve specific goals, often with a  degree of   autonomy .  •   Key Characteristics:  •   Perceives:   Gathers information from its  environment.  •   Reasons:   Processes information, makes  decisions, and plans.  •   Acts:   Executes decided - upon actions.  •   Learns:   Continuously improves performance  over time.  •   Goal - Oriented:   Driven by specific objectives.  •   Autonomous:   Operates with independence.  •   Proactive:   Initiates actions, doesn't just react.\n\n\n\nVarious Popular framework in market  •   OpenAI SDK  •   CrewAI  •   Langgraph  •   Autogen\n\nCrewAI   Terminologies  •   CrewAI Flows   –   Deterministic /auditability  •   CrewAI Crews   –   Autonomous/Creative CrewAI   Frameworks  •   LLM, Role, Goal, Backstory, memory/tools AI Agents  •   Description, Expected output, Agent Tasks  •   Set of Tasks and Agents  •   Sequential or Hierarchical The Crew\n\nSimple First Lab  (Lab   - 7)  •   crewai create crew <project - name>  •   crewai run  Command  •   Agent : Debater, Judge  •   Task : Proposer, opposer, decide  •   Crew : Agents, Task   - > Sequential Mode  Debater project\n\nSecond Coder Lab  (Lab 8)  •   crewai create crew <project - name>  •   crewai run  Command  •   Agent : Coder  •   Task : coding task  •   Crew : Agents, Task   - > Sequential Mode  Coder\n\nLunch  1:30 pm to 2:15 pm\n\nRAG  2:15 to 3:00 pm\n\nThe RAG  Retrieval Augmented Generation  •   What is RAG ? Why we need it?  •   When we have Relational DB and non -  Relational DB , why we need a vector DB?  •   What is context and how its helpful?\n\nRAG Concepts  •   King   –   Man + Woman = Queen  •   Paris   –   France + Italy = Rome  •   Morning   –   Sun + Moon = Night  •   CSK   –   Chennai + Mumbai = MI  •   Pizza   –   Italy + India = Dosa\n\nRAG Concepts  •   Type of Vector DB Available  •   Chroma  •   FAISSS(Facebook AI Similarity Search)  •   RAG Strategy  Chunk size vs chunk overlap vs chunk counts  provided to context  •   Smaller chunks   –   Dense documents   eg   code,  medical notes  •   Larger chunks   -   t he document is narrative, story -  like, or the context needs to flow   e.g., novels,  blogs, research papers).\n\nRAG Concepts  Lab   - 9  Overlap  •   Small overlap   -   Use when: Content is  self - contained per section (e.g., FAQs,  product descriptions).  •   Large Overlap   -   Use when: Information  connects tightly across boundaries (e.g.,  step - by - step instructions, programming  code, math proofs).  Number of Chunks  •   For   precise tasks   (like medical Q&A,  coding help): fewer chunks (K=2 – 3).  •   For   exploratory tasks   (like  summarization, brainstorming): more  chunks (K=5 – 6).\n\nOpenAI SDK  3:00 to 4:00 pm\n\nOPEN AI SDK  •   https://openai.github.io/openai - agents -  python/  Terminologies  •   Recap on async io   –   async and await  •   Create an Agent  •   With Trace  •   Run the Agent\n\nLab 10 and Lab 11  Lab 10   –   Hello World   Lab 11   –   Cold email Selection\n\nEval,   GuardRails ,   Halluconation  till 5:00 pm\n\nWithout  Guardrails\n\nGuardrails\n\nGuardrails  •   Guardrails   -   Architecture  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guardrails -  ai/guardrails/main/docs/img/with_and_without_gua  rdrails.svg  •   PreBuilt   Guardrails   https://hub.guardrailsai.com  •   Github   repo :   https://github.com/guardrails -  ai/guardrails?tab=readme - ov - file\n\nGuardRails, Evals  and Hallucination  •   Evals   are like   checkpoints   where  you test if something is working  well. You inspect the AI’s  behaviour   —   “Is this correct? Is  this safe? Is this what I  expected?”  •   Guardrails   are like   bumpers or  rails   along the sides of a path that  prevent the AI from going too far  off track or making dangerous  mistakes in the first place.  •   Hallucination   –   is lying under the  teeth confidently",
